# About-Me
## ChangeLog

* 7th of June

Project start and file creation.
Add some elements to the HTML page
And add a quiz of 5 questions (yes/no) about me.

* 8th of June 

Add two questions on the quiz
The first makes the user expect a number and has four attempts
The one who predicts a color has six attempts
Add colors to the site
And a list of 10 things for an HTML page

* 9th of June 

We have moved all the logic to the main three functions, one of them accepts an argument, which is a list containing other lists that themselves include the questions, correct answers and responses. Only for the first question we did some restructuring, but for the other two we only cleaned our code and moved it inside wrapper functions to reduce the need for repetition.
