We have moved all the logic to the main three functions, one of them accepts an argument, which is a list containing other lists that themselves include the questions, correct answers and responses. Only for the first question we did some restructuring, but for the other two we only cleaned our code and moved it inside wrapper functions to reduce the need for repetition.
